/*
 * While loops start with an initial condition and end with a
 * terminal condition
 * While loops continue until a condition is met
 * For loops check for a given range
 * Key elements:
 * 
 * Initial conditions, statements, looping condition
 * 
 * while (condition) {
 *  statements if true
 * }
 * 
 * terminating condition if statement is false
 * Condition is checked once per iteration
 * While loops should have some sort of update statement
 * so the while condition returns false
 * 
 * While loops are best used when the iteration is not known
 * A sentinel value is a value that will stop the loop
 * 
 * Loop tracing is understanding what the loop variables produce
 * like loop count.
 * 
 * Iterator is an object that allows you to process a collection
 * one item at a time.
 * 
 * Nested loops have loops inside another loop
 * The inside loop will run before returning back to the outer loop
 * limitX = 10
 * LimitY = 5
 * countX = 1
 * count Y = 1
 * 
 * countY = 1 (this resets the count from 6 back to 1)
 * countX++ (this increments the outer loop from 1 to 2)
 * 1: 12345
 * 2: 246810
 * 3: ...
 * 4: ...
 * 10: 1020304050
