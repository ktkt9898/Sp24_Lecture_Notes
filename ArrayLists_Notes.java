/**
 * Array List is a way to store a lot of objects in one place
 * 
 * Every element in the array is given an index, starting at 0.
 * When adding to an array, it adds to the end of the array list
 * unless specifically told to add it somewhere else.
 * 
 * ArrayList can only hold objects and must have a type
 * 
 * When an array is instantiated, it is empty
 * Cannot mix types in Java, so only String ArrayLists can have type
 * of strings
