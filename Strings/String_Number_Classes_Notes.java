/**
 * Each individual letter of a string is stored in memory and can be
 * accessed with methods.
 * The first position, or index, starts at 0. (Zero-based indexing, and
 * is because it starts at the 0th address)
 * The last index is always n-1
 * Substring with endIndex does not including the ending position (again, 
 * because of zero based indexing)
 * Characters is viewed as normal one based index.
 * 
 * Deicmal Format requires a decimal format object, with parameters.
 * The method df.format() is called on the double value.
 * (#.00), specifies two decimal digits, and if no decimals exist, return
 * two zeroes instead
