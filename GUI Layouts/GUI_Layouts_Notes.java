/**
 * BorderLayout allows North, South, West, East, and Center
 * GridLayout is organized in a grid and will resize if the window is resized
 * 
 * A great way to organize a GUI is to layer panels
 * 
 * GUIs should be independent from backend, so
 * the TicTacToe game should not depend on anything specific
 * to the GUI
 * 
 * Layout must be set before more panels can be added
 * 
 * A BorderLayout can only have one component
