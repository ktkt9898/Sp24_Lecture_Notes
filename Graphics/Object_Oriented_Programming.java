/**
 * Objects repesent real world information
 * 
 * Class itself manages the methods that can be used (unless writing
 * the class)
 * 
 * Object have a state and a behavior
 * name, breed, age
 * bark, fetch, sleep
 * 
 * String "Hello!"
 * state of characters
 * behaviors of getLength
 * 
 * Attributes represent an object's state, or field
 * Rectangle object has int weight and int height attributes
 * Behaviors could be getLength, getArea of the rectangle
 * 
 * Class is a blueprint on how to create objects
 * Defines what attributes and methods (behaviors) that objects
 * will contain
 * 
 * public class Dog{
 *  private string name;
 *  private int age;
 * 
 *  public int getAge();
 *  public return age;
 * }
 * 
 * Private prefixes ensure data can only be access by methods
 * that the class allows
 * Public prefix allows methods to be used
 * 
 * Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
 * Scanner is the class name
 * Input the variable name
 * New indidcates allowcating memory to make the object
 * Scanner(System.in) is a constructor method to set up 
 * object data
 * 
 * All objects are stored as reference types but each object has 
 * its own set of data.
 * This refernce type still lies on the stack but refers to the heap.
 * This allows multiple objects to be created under the same class.
 * Primative types are stored in their variable on the stack
 *
