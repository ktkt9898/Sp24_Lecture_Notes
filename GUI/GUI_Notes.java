/**
 * Event Driven Programming:
 * Program waits for an event to happen, determined by user actions,
 * then program responds
 * 
 * An EventListener is a method that responds to a event
 * thru user action
 * 
 * JFrame is the outline/base of the GUI
 * JPanel fills the frame and takes up space
 * JLabel are text components
 * JButton allows user action
 * 
 * Generally the size should correspond to the Frame or
 * Panel to avoid dimension issues
 * 
 * JPanel is combined with the extends prefix, which allows
 * inheritance/borrowing methods
 * 
 * ButtonListener should be a private class and have one
 * method called actionPerformed (void)
 * ActionEvent should be casted to the button/class name
 * 
 * 1. Create a panel to store components
 * 2. Declare and instantiate components
 * 3. Add action listeners to components as necessary
 * 4. Add componenets to Panel
 * 
 * Panels can be stacked onto eachother. One panel
 * can fill the role of being the main panel
 * and then two panels can be filed inside to separate
 * functions
